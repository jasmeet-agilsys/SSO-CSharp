### Using Identity Server for Multiple Applications

This README provides guidance on setting up and utilizing Identity Server for multiple applications. It includes configurations for Identity Server and two client applications (`app1` and `app2`).

#### Identity Server Configuration (IdentityServer)

##### Startup.cs

The `Startup.cs` file configures Identity Server services and middleware.

- `ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)`: Configures Identity Server services.
- `Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)`: Configures middleware pipeline.

##### Config.cs

Contains static methods to define clients, identity resources, API scopes, and test users.

#### Client Application 1 (app1)

##### Startup.cs

Configures authentication and authorization for `app1`.

- `ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)`: Configures authentication services.
- `Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)`: Configures middleware pipeline.

##### HomeController.cs

Defines controllers and actions for `app1`.

- `Index()`: Returns the main view.
- `Secure()`: Requires authorization to access a secure view.
- `Logout()`: Initiates the logout process.

#### Client Application 2 (app2)

_Note: Details for `app2` are not provided but should follow a similar structure as `app1`._

### Using the Identity Server Setup

1. **Identity Server Setup**
   - Ensure `Startup.cs` and `Config.cs` are correctly implemented and configured.
   - Customize client configurations in `Config.cs` to fit your requirements.
2. **Client Application Setup**
   - For each client application (e.g., `app1`, `app2`), follow these steps:
     - Configure authentication and authorization in `Startup.cs`.
     - Implement controllers and actions, ensuring proper authorization attributes.
     - Customize client settings (e.g., `ClientId`, `RedirectUris`) to match those defined in Identity Server's `Config.cs`.
3. **Testing**
   - Launch Identity Server and the client applications.
   - Verify authentication, authorization, and logout functionality across applications.
4. **Further Customization**
   - Extend or modify configurations as needed for additional features or security requirements.
   - Ensure proper handling of user sessions, tokens, and security best practices.
5. **Documentation**
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation detailing configurations, setup, and any customizations made.

For more detailed information and troubleshooting, refer to official documentation for Identity Server and ASP.NET Core.
